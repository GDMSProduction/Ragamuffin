This "ARCHIVE" folder is for all assets that are no longer currently being used in the project.

All assets deemed useless or out-of-date should be placed in this folder.

Doing this will keep the hiearchy clean, and make it much easier for the Game Devs to find what they need in the "Assets" folder.
